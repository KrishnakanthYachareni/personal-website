This project has contributed to developing an efficient geographic information system and serves in assisting in developing a dynamic set of resources through the Geographic information system database using MongoDB, Amazon S3 bucket.
The annotation explorer is focused on retrieving actual data (currently .jpgs and .mp4s) from the associated expeditions via the labels on the information. These labels are currently provided through Hyperion Technology Group's (HTG) work on their annotation application and pushed back to the AQUAVIEW database via a Python script.
