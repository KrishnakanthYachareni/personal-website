It is an IOT based Android project. The clients search for hostel through our APP and vendor maintains the data in database with the help of biometric device through our app. So, the problem we are solving is “searching an appropriate hostel on the Client side and on the vendor side hostel maintenance system” with the help of a Finger Print recognizer.
