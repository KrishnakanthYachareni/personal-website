This project is intended to for Fish detection using [Fathomnet](https://fathomnet.org/fathomnet/#/) Images Dataset and Tensorflow Object Detection.
Currently, this project fetches the fish annotated images along with bounding boxes and the metadata of the image will be downloaded into hard drive of the machine.
Bounding boxes will be saved as csv file with image tag id belong to it. Overall fathom dataset has 2750 HD images and size more than 500 GB.
