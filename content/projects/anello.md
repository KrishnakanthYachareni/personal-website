I built an interpreter on top of JDK compiler, Anello is a programming language which means Object-Oriented Hybrid of Java and BASIC. Anello parser can convert the Anello program into native java program which can be executed by java compiler. The usage of this programming language reduces the size of code which should be written in java.
