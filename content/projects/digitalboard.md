Basically We don't have any direct interaction or contact with our University principal, Head of the Department, Staff and Students. Here I've designed an android application for our university which can be used as Notice Board. In this app you can directly ask any information if you require to any one of our higher officials. For example information regarding Exams, Bundhs, Events..etc.
