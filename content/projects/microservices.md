Created a couple of microservices and get them to talk to each other using Eureka Naming Server and Ribbon for Client Side Load Balancing. That is Currency Conversion Service (CCS) can convert a bucket of currencies into another currency. It uses the Forex Service to get current currency exchange values. Implemented the microservice architecture principles here.
